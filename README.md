# Dog Selector

## About
Dog Selector is a Rails app built with a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to help a user interested in getting a dog narrow down the selection and decide what breed would work best for them. Asking several simple questions about the user's lifestyle and general preferences in a pet, it then combs an existing "Breeds" table for options that meet the submitted criteria.

It returns a list of breeds, each one a link to page 1 of Google search results for that breed to enable the user to learn more about this breed.

### Future Plans
Dog Selector is very much a work in progress, and as such probably should *not* be used to make any sort of final decision about a breed, but rather should serve more as a jumping off point. Future changes to look for if you end up liking the app:

* Breed info updates for accuracy (*should help with targeting*)
* Wider selection of breeds
* Ability to search for shelters / rescue centers in your area
* Alerts about dogs in high-kill shelters
